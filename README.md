Some random tools I made during the Project Skydrop treasure hunt:

* Base 3 visualizer and decoder.  Shows four strips of base3 symbols from the trophy puzzle, along with their corresponding base-3, base-16, and ASCII decodings.
  * [Demo](https://doranchak.github.io/project-skydrop/base3.html)
* Distance calculator.  A quick and dirty distance calculator for two GPS coordinates.  Calculates distance and bearing, and embeds maps for the two points.  First point is hard-coded to the location of the trophy.
  * [Demo](https://doranchak.github.io/project-skydrop/distance.html)   
* "Final Puzzle" decoder.  Select words from the BIP-39 wordlist and the tool dumps the 21 messages generated from them.
